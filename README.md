# CFA Config Generator

## Overview

Scripts and utils to generate configuration objects for modeling pipelines. The first version of this will support [{EpiNow2}](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2), but will be extensible to other
projects down the line.

## Use as a library
This repository can be used as a library for other projects. Below are two examples of using the functionality to generate config files in Blob.

```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta

from cfa_config_generator.utils.epinow2.driver_functions import (
    generate_config,
    generate_rerun_config,
)
from cfa_config_generator.utils.epinow2.functions import generate_default_job_id

today: date = date.today()
now: datetime = datetime.now()

# Generate and upload to blob for all states and diseases.
generate_config(
    state="all",
    disease="all",
    report_date=today,
    reference_dates=[today - timedelta(days=1), today - timedelta(weeks=8)],
    data_path=f"gold/{today.isoformat()}.parquet",
    data_container="nssp-etl",
    production_date=today,
    job_id=generate_default_job_id(now.isoformat()),
    as_of_date=now.isoformat(),
    output_container="nssp-rt-testing",
)

# For reruns. Note that if we did not pass in state="all" and disease="all",
# there is a risk of accidentally excluding a state-disease pair that is in the
# data exclusions file. For example, if I ran this with state="NY" and
# disease="COVID-19", and the data exclusions file contained a row for
# "WA,Influenza", then no config would be generated for WA,Influenza.
# We should clean this up in the future.
generate_rerun_config(
    state="all",
    disease="all",
    report_date=today,
    reference_dates=[today - timedelta(days=1), today - timedelta(weeks=8)],
    data_path=f"gold/{today.isoformat()}.parquet",
    data_container="nssp-etl",
    production_date=today,
    job_id=generate_default_job_id(now.isoformat()),
    as_of_date=now.isoformat(),
    output_container="nssp-rt-testing",
    data_exclusions_path="az://nssp-etl/outliers-v2/2025-04-23.csv",
)
```
